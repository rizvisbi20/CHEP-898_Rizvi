A synthetic cohort of ~100,000 patients who have no prior history of AF and had a baseline ECG performed between January 2010 and January 2023, 
followed by a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Current or prior AF/flutter will be excluded on the basis of baseline ECG plus review of prior 
continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter), ICD-10-CA codes, or procedural codes related to AF/flutter interventions. This synthetic dataset has been 
generated by training off a randomly identified subset of ~100,000 patients from the Cardiovascular Imaging Registry of Calgary (CIROC).
