A synthetic cohort of ~100,000 patients who have no prior history of AF and had a baseline ECG performed between January 2010 and January 2023, 
followed by a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Current or prior AF/flutter will be excluded on the basis of baseline ECG plus review of prior 
continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter), ICD-10-CA codes, or procedural codes related to AF/flutter interventions. This synthetic dataset has been 
generated by training off a randomly identified subset of ~100,000 patients from the Cardiovascular Imaging Registry of Calgary (CIROC).

Dataset Name: Prediction of New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Using ECG Variables
Source: Statistical Society of Canada (SSC)
Dataset Size:

Rows: Likely hundreds to thousands (exact count not specified)
Columns: Multiple (ECG variables + clinical features)
Format: Likely CSV or database (details not explicit)
Relevance: Ideal for healthcare ML, predicting cardiac events using ECG data.

Key Variables:

P-wave duration, PR interval, QRS duration (Numerical, milliseconds)
Age, Sex (Clinical covariates)
New-onset AF (Binary target: Yes/No)
Complexity Factors:

Missing ECG data due to measurement errors.
Requires preprocessing (normalization, handling class imbalance).
Mix of numerical and categorical features.
Potential Applications:

Predict AF risk using logistic regression or Random Forest.
Analyze ECG feature importance for early diagnosis.
